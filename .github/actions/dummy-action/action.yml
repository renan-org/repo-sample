# Dummy Custom Action
# This composite action demonstrates how local actions work within a repository.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT PATH USAGE:
# - This action is referenced internally using RELATIVE paths (e.g., ./.github/actions/dummy-action/)
# - NO git markers (like @v1, @main, @sha) are needed when referencing locally
# - External repositories consuming our reusable workflow will use git markers on the WORKFLOW,
#   but this action will still be referenced via relative path from within that workflow
#
# Example internal usage in reusable workflow:
#   uses: ./.github/actions/dummy-action/
#
# External repos will NOT reference this action directly. They reference the reusable workflow with:
#   uses: githubcustomers/optiver/.github/workflows/dummy-reusable.yml@v1
# And the reusable workflow internally references this action via relative path.
